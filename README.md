## Abstract

Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes represents a promising route for valorizing biomass-derived feedstocks. However, achieving efficient and selective aldehyde hydrogenation remains challenging, due in part to an insufficient understanding of reaction mechanisms under operational conditions. In this study, we reveal a strong correlation between electrochemical hydrogenation performance and the local solvent environment. We show that a hydrophilic region near the carbonyl oxygen facilitates hydrogenation via the Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanism, wherein solvent water molecules participate directly in the reaction. In contrast, a hydrophobic interface characterized by a rigid hydrogen-bond network suppresses ER-based hydrogenation at the carbon site. Only when the hydrogen-bond network becomes looser can carbon hydrogenation via the ER pathway be activated. These mechanistic insights clarify how the solvent environment dictates the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of aromatic aldehydes, pointing toward a viable strategy of tuning the solvent microenvironment to enhance electrocatalytic selectivity in biomass upgrading.
